### Inspiration
"Energy earns or simply burns, the choice is yours. Energy misused cannot be excused."

### What it does
DiscoverPower helps you check your power consumption for different time span daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly,half-yearly. Furthermore, provides a feature to check the gauge the power consumption wrt to the average power consumption in your locality with the same apartment size and number of people.

### How we built it
The Google Cloud Platform is used to store the dataset for power consumption. Cloud SQL for MySQL is used to run queries based on the user and time span of power consumption. The data representation is implemented in Tableau. The mobile app, React-native is used to create an application for both Android and ios phones.
